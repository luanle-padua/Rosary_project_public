# The Rosary Project

**Pray the Rosary | The Rosary Journey**  

https://prayingrosary.vercel.app

I began my journey of faith three years ago. Though it came late, it was perfectly timed for my life‚Äôs path. From places to people, work, and perspectives on life, everything around me transformed completely. I am deeply grateful for all these changes.  

In 2021, during a pilgrimage to Fatima, I made a promise to Our Lady to pray the Rosary daily. This promise not only strengthened my faith but also inspired me to create this website. It is a small yet heartfelt space where I hope everyone can join in prayer, share their faith, and find peace in every prayer.  

I am not a professional web developer, but with perseverance, some self-taught skills, and the support of AI, this website came to life. I hope it helps everyone pray the Rosary anytime, anywhere, whether you are alone or not.  

‚ú® **Highlights of the website**:  

- üó£Ô∏è **Bilingual support**: Vietnamese and English.  
- üìø **Automatic Rosary beads**: Displays the position of each bead during prayer.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable reading speed**: Slow or fast, tailored to your preference.  
- üìÖ **Mystery updates by day**: Synced with the liturgical calendar.  
- üë• **Real-time prayer count**: See the number of people praying with you.  
- üì± **Optimized design**: Smooth experience across all devices.  

üì∑ **Notes**:  
- All images used are from the public domain, ensuring no copyright infringement.  
- The Vietnamese prayer recordings were made by me. The English prayer voice, currently being prepared by Tuyet Mai, will be updated soon for a more complete experience!  

üí¨ **Let‚Äôs develop together**:  
I want to share this project with the community and invite everyone to collaborate. You can contribute by adding new languages, images, or creating new features in the future.
